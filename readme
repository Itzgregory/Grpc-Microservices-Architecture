This a system where small independent services talk to each other using gRPC. 
Each service has its own database and does one specific job.

Author Service - Handles author data.
    Method	Request	Response	Description
    CreateAuthor	{ name: string, email: string }	{ id: string, name: string, email: string, createdAt: string }	Creates a new author
    GetAuthor	{ id: string }	{ id: string, name: string, email: string, createdAt: string }	Fetches details of an author by ID
    UpdateAuthor	{ id: string, name?: string, email?: string }	{ success: boolean, message: string }	Updates author details
    DeleteAuthor	{ id: string }	{ success: boolean, message: string }	Deletes an author
    ListAuthors	{}	{ authors: [ { id, name, email, createdAt } ] }	Fetches all authors

Book Service - Handles book data.
    Method	Request	Response	Description
    CreateBook	{ title: string, authorId: string, publishedYear: int }	{ id: string, title: string, authorId: string, publishedYear: int, createdAt: string }	Creates a new book
    GetBook	{ id: string }	{ id: string, title: string, authorId: string, publishedYear: int, createdAt: string }	Fetches book details
    UpdateBook	{ id: string, title?: string, publishedYear?: int }	{ success: boolean, message: string }	Updates book details
    DeleteBook	{ id: string }	{ success: boolean, message: string }	Deletes a book
    ListBooks	{}	{ books: [ { id, title, authorId, publishedYear, createdAt } ] }	Fetches all books
    GetBooksByAuthor	{ authorId: string }	{ books: [ { id, title, publishedYear, createdAt } ] }	Retrieves all books by an author


NestJS, Docker, Kubernetes, Prisma, and PostgreSQL was used to make everything work smoothly.

*** Services Talking to Each Other ***
I store .proto files in proto/ to define how services communicate.
Each service acts as both a server and a client using gRPC.

*** DB ***
Each service has its own Prisma schema for database management.
Prisma helps this projeect talk to the PostgreSQL database easily.


*** FLOW STATE ***
I’d go to the Docker website, download Docker Desktop, and install it like any other app.
Then, I’d sign up for a free Docker Hub account (this is where I can store my Docker images).
After installing, I’d log in to Docker Desktop with my new account.

If I installed Docker Desktop, Kubernetes is already there! I just need to turn it on in the settings.
If I want another option, I can install Minikube, which lets me run Kubernetes on my computer.
To talk to Kubernetes, I’d need kubectl, a command-line tool that I can download from the Kubernetes website.

***DEPLOYMENT STEPS***
Each service has its own Dockerfile so Ican run them in containers.
Iuse Kubernetes to manage and connect these containers.


Configuration files are kept in the k8s/ folder.
1. AT THIS POINT THE GOAL IS TO BUILD AND PUSH THE DOCKER IMAGE
docker build -t Itsgregory-username/author-service ./apps/author-service
docker build -t Itsgregory-username/book-service ./apps/book-service

docker push Itsgregory-username/author-service
docker push Itsgregory-username/book-service

2. AT THIS POINT THE GOAL IS TO APPLY THE KUBERNETES MANIFESTS
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres/secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres/pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres/service.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/author-service/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/author-service/service.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/book-service/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/book-service/service.yaml


*** Places for Improvement ***
1. Make sure all services can talk to each other even more smoothly.
2. Improve security (like authentication and rate limiting).
3. Add CI/CD pipelines to automate updates and deployment.
